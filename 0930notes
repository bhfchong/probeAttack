Recap:
When you probe, you get the probe/attack costs and utilites of all neighbors of the probed node. 
FK and LK: FK can't be improved upon. LK with total independence, just blind.

What if:
Knowing correlations between the node you're probing and its degree. Select nodes to probe more cleverly

What I did:
Max Probe defined, then all probe costs scaled to betweenness centrality. 
Somehow.. LK runs better than LKP? And more nodes end up being visible at the end of LK vs LKP?!?
Changed probe cost to 1, but betweenness of visible nodes is known. LKP better than LK now. This indicates that the increased probe cost isn't worth the increased visiblity.
Same for when regressing-> pick cheapest to prob with highest expected new nodes Improves number of total visible nodes, score improves, but only if probe cost is 1

Scaled as degree?

Pretty good when



Other expts:
Attack cost? probe cost?

Intrinsic utility: Utility derived from killing just that node
Indirect utility: Eg, a high-degree node 


think about minesweeper lol
